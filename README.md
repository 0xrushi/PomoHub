# PomoHub 🍅⏰📈

## Introduction
Welcome to PomoHub, the first open-source group-based Pomodoro timer inspired by the much-loved but now discontinued service from Fiveable. PomoHub is designed to help teams, study groups, and friends boost their productivity by enabling them to share and participate in Pomodoro sessions together, in real-time, from anywhere in the world. 🌍💻🤝
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes. 🍅⏰😌

## Features ✨
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Join a room and participate in Pomodoro sessions with your team or friends in real-time. 🙌
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Access PomoHub from any web-enabled device, no installation required. 📱💻
- **Open-Source:** PomoHub is fully open-source, welcoming contributions from developers interested in enhancing its features and reach. 🌟
- **Cute and Engaging Interface:** Enjoy a delightful and motivating user experience with our adorable Pomodoro mascot and intuitive design. 🍅💕

### Note on Server Costs and Database

To keep PomoHub accessible and minimize server costs, the current version of the application does not utilize a backend database. This design decision helps to reduce the overhead associated with data storage and management but means that certain features, like persistent history or accounts, are not available at this time.

### Interested in Contributing a Database Solution?

We understand the importance of data persistence for enhancing user experience and functionality. If you're interested in contributing to PomoHub by integrating a database solution, we would love to see your pull requests!

Adding a database would open up new possibilities for features such as user accounts, session history, and more detailed productivity analytics. We encourage anyone with ideas or the technical ability to implement such features to contribute to the project.


We welcome contributions from the community! If you're interested in improving PomoHub, please take a look at our contributing guidelines. You can contribute in various ways such as submitting bug reports, suggesting enhancements, and adding code changes to improve functionality or fix issues 🐛💻✨.
